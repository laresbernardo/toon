\title{Convert TOON String Back to R Object}
\usage{
from_toon(toon_string)
}
\arguments{
\item{toon_string}{A character vector containing the TOON string.}
}
\value{
The reconstructed R object (list, vector, or data frame).
}
\description{
Parses a TOON string and reconstructs the corresponding R list,
vector, or data frame structure. This function acts as the inverse of 
\code{\link{as_toon}}.
}
\examples{
# 1. Simple Object (Named List)
toon_obj <- 'version: 1.0\nis_active: true\nuser_id: 99'
from_toon(toon_obj)
# Expected output: list(version = 1, is_active = TRUE, user_id = 99)

# 2. Expanded Array (Unnamed List)
toon_array <- '[3]:\n - "apple"\n - host: "red"\n   weight: 150\n - "banana"'
from_toon(toon_array)
# Expected output: list("apple", list(host = "red", weight = 150), "banana")

# 3. Data Frame
toon_df <- '[2]{time,action,success}:\n 9.1,"login",true\n 15.4,"update",false'
from_toon(toon_df)
# Expected output: A data frame with 2 rows and 3 columns

# 4. Primitive Array (Vector)
toon_vec <- '[3]: 10,20,"thirty"'
from_toon(toon_vec)
# Expected output: c("10", "20", "thirty") (as all elements are coerced to character due to mix)
